# Rebuild Fixture Diff Desk through small verified slices

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

This is a hypothetical reconstruction exercise using the existing reference as a comparison point. Work on a practice branch or a separate scratch copy. Do not erase the working reference. Your goal is to recover the important decisions from requirements, not reproduce every character or configuration file from memory.

## Session zero: write a contract you can challenge

The desk parses two JSON objects separately and accepts only flat scalar values: strings, finite numbers, booleans and null. It rejects arrays, nested structures and non-finite parsed numbers. Comparison returns sorted added, removed and changed keys, using own-property presence so missing differs from null. Equality uses Object.is, including its signed-zero distinction. Parsing errors name the Before or After side.

Your target skill is structured comparison and explicit limits. Write three examples before implementation: one ordinary success, one boundary distinction and one recovery or repeat sequence. Reuse the fixed reference fixtures only after making a prediction. If your new example is outside the documented scope, decide whether to reject it or explicitly expand the contract; do not let an incidental implementation choice decide silently.

Write a short non-goal list tied to this exercise. Non-goals keep an assistant from adding a database, a UI framework or a broad refactor before you understand the central rule. For static layout work, a meaningful non-goal may be scripting interactions that native HTML already handles. For stateful work, it may be remote persistence or a global state container.

## Slice 1: Separate syntax and shape

**Reference context:** Invalid JSON cannot reach the object validator. Valid JSON such as an array or null still fails the flat-object contract. A nested object has valid syntax but unsupported structure. These distinctions let the error explain what to fix instead of collapsing every failure into an unhelpful parse error.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **{} → {x:null} → x added, not unchanged**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.
3. Build the smallest version that can express the example. Start with explicit data and direct control flow. Introduce a helper only when you can name its input, output and reason to change.
4. Observe the result through the real boundary: a command, a browser control, or a layout condition. A function returning the right value does not prove a button passes it the right input.
5. Add a neighboring example that would fail if you special-cased the first one. Review your diff before comparing with the reference.

### Pause at the first uncertainty

Write the smallest question you cannot answer. It might concern ownership, a comparison operator, the effect of deleting a property, or when a callback actually runs. Include the exact expression and an example. Ask a mentor for one clue, then return to the source; avoid requesting a complete replacement implementation.

### Inspect an alternative

Choose one plausible different design for this slice. Describe the extra state, dependency or maintenance rule it introduces. If it satisfies the same contract, it is not automatically wrong. Compare the cost of making the next small change. If it violates the contract, provide the smallest concrete example that demonstrates that violation.

### Capture a reviewable stopping point

Record your actual check: npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. State what it established and what remains untested. Use a commit message about the resulting behavior rather than a list of file names. If the slice does not work yet, keep the uncertainty visible in the journal instead of writing a success narrative.

**Left for you:** the code, fixture values beyond the supplied example, exact naming and the acceptance evidence. The reference is available for comparison after an attempt; it is not evidence that your branch has passed.

## Slice 2: Walk the key union

**Reference context:** Write a table with columns key, present-before, present-after and equality. Classify added and removed before comparing values. For unchanged keys produce no row. This hand table is an independent expected result for a small regression fixture.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **{x:1} → {x:'1'} → x changed because value type differs**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.

## Slice 3: Probe awkward names

**Reference context:** JSON.parse creates data properties for keys such as __proto__. The core uses own keys and Object.hasOwn to compare them. No merging into a general configuration object occurs. Test one prototype-looking key to expose an inherited-property assumption without expanding into a full recursive serializer.

## Slice 4: Invalidate old output

**Reference context:** The textareas can change after a comparison. Their input handlers replace the result with a compare-again message. This is a simple way to prevent a correct result for an earlier input from appearing current. A future live-diff mode would require a separate rendering policy.

## Reconstruct the whole path without the guide

Compare → parse Before and validate its flat shape → parse After and validate it → union their own keys and sort → classify absent/present/value differences → render changes or No changes. Editing either input invalidates the displayed comparison.

Close this page and redraw that route from memory using your own labels. Open the code only to resolve a specific uncertainty. Then trace a different valid input and one boundary. If your picture requires a hidden value that you cannot locate in the source, investigate it; diagrams can invent state just as easily as prose can.

## Compare your implementation fairly

First compare behavior and evidence. Only then compare style and abstractions. A shorter implementation may be harder for you to explain; a longer implementation may duplicate a rule that later drifts. State the concrete tradeoff. Do not treat matching the reference line for line as the only successful outcome.

## Finish with a teach-back

Explain why `diffFlat` is enough for its present responsibility, which work remains in `public/app.js`, and which future requirement would justify changing that boundary. Answer the original transfer question: What is the difference between two values being unequal and one value being absent? Keep the answer short enough that another junior can challenge it with an example.
