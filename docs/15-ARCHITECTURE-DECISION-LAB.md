# M020: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Keep the supported shape small

**Reference rationale:** A recursive diff needs decisions about arrays, paths, ordering and cycles that are unnecessary for this learning step. parseFlat rejects nested objects rather than returning an incomplete result that looks authoritative. Direct diffFlat callers are expected to supply already validated flat objects; the browser always uses the parser first.

**Question to resolve:** What would an array-diff contract need to say before implementation?

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/core.js` and `public/app.js`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Test presence separately from value

**Reference rationale:** Reading before[key] alone cannot distinguish an absent key from some present values in general. Object.hasOwn explicitly asks whether the record owns the key. This also treats names such as constructor and __proto__ as data rather than accidentally finding inherited properties.

**Question to resolve:** Why is key in object a different question from Object.hasOwn?

## Decision review 3: Make output order deterministic

**Reference rationale:** Sorting the union of keys makes two logically equivalent inputs produce the same review order even when their JSON properties were typed differently. The comparison does not mutate either object. Deterministic order supports readable tests and human review without claiming JSON property order has business meaning.

**Question to resolve:** Would a sorted result still be appropriate if original source order carried meaning?

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

What is the difference between two values being unequal and one value being absent?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
