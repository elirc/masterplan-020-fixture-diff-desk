# Code tour and architecture decisions

[Overview](../README.md) · [Concepts](02-CONCEPTS-AND-TRACES.md)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [package.json](../package.json) | Names the module format, Node requirement and local commands; private prevents npm publication. |
| [.github/workflows/check.yml](../.github/workflows/check.yml) | Runs the committed checks on GitHub. A workflow file is not evidence that a remote run succeeded. |
| [public/index.html](../public/index.html) | Semantic content, controls and explicit IDs. |
| [public/style.css](../public/style.css) | Presentation, focus indication and project-specific layout. |
| [tools/serve.mjs](../tools/serve.mjs) | Local preview infrastructure; only public/ is served. |
| [tools/check-site.mjs](../tools/check-site.mjs) | Checks referenced local assets exist, without pretending to judge usability. |
| [public/core.js](../public/core.js) | The main input/output rule; no DOM access. |
| [public/app.js](../public/app.js) | Browser events, parsing, rendering and visible errors. |
| [test/core.test.js](../test/core.test.js) | Independent boundary examples for the core contract. |

## Follow one path, not every file

Start at [public/core.js](../public/core.js) and locate `diffFlat`. Use this trace as a map: Compare → parse Before and validate its flat shape → parse After and validate it → union their own keys and sort → classify absent/present/value differences → render changes or No changes. Editing either input invalidates the displayed comparison.

The tooling is intentionally separate from the product concept. You can study the local server or CI after the main rule is clear. Neither an HTTP preview server nor a workflow configuration should become a prerequisite for understanding a small pure function.

## Decision: Keep the supported shape small

A recursive diff needs decisions about arrays, paths, ordering and cycles that are unnecessary for this learning step. parseFlat rejects nested objects rather than returning an incomplete result that looks authoritative. Direct diffFlat callers are expected to supply already validated flat objects; the browser always uses the parser first.

**Review question:** What would an array-diff contract need to say before implementation?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Test presence separately from value

Reading before[key] alone cannot distinguish an absent key from some present values in general. Object.hasOwn explicitly asks whether the record owns the key. This also treats names such as constructor and __proto__ as data rather than accidentally finding inherited properties.

**Review question:** Why is key in object a different question from Object.hasOwn?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Make output order deterministic

Sorting the union of keys makes two logically equivalent inputs produce the same review order even when their JSON properties were typed differently. The comparison does not mutate either object. Deterministic order supports readable tests and human review without claiming JSON property order has business meaning.

**Review question:** Would a sorted result still be appropriate if original source order carried meaning?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Change boundaries

A small change should begin in the file that owns its meaning. Change domain rules in the core (`public/core.js`), wording and interaction in the browser adapter (`public/app.js`), and layout in the relevant CSS rule.

If a story crosses two files, say why. A new option may require the core contract, a control and tests to change together. That is a coherent feature boundary, not permission to rewrite unrelated parts of the project.

## Deliberate limits

Persistence and frameworks are explicit where used: M019 saves a namespaced local draft; M024–M025 introduce React. The remaining builds use plain JavaScript and local data. M025 saved definitions last for the current session only. The preview server is a local development aid, not a production hosting system. A browser screenshot is one observation, not proof of every device or assistive technology. Keep these limits visible when describing your own work.
